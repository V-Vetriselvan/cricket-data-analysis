# Cricket Data Analysis (Python + SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **IPL cricket datasets** to uncover insights about player performance, team trends, and match outcomes.  
It uses **Python, SQL, and data visualization tools** to clean raw data, perform analysis, and generate meaningful reports.  
The project demonstrates how analytics can be applied to sports data for better understanding and decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (Joins, Group By, Aggregates)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for final presentation of insights)

## ⚙️ Features
- Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, handled duplicates, and standardized formats.
- SQL Queries: Extracted player stats, team performance, and match summaries.
- Python Analysis: Used Pandas for manipulation and Matplotlib for visualizations.
- Insights on top-performing batsmen, bowlers, and winning strategies.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain players consistently performed across multiple IPL seasons.
- Teams batting first had a slight advantage in winning percentage.
- Top batsmen and bowlers were identified based on runs, strike rates, and wickets.
- Visualization of scoring patterns by overs and match conditions.
